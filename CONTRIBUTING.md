# Contributing

Github is used to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development process

[Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is used as a development process. This means that all changes are done by creating pull requests. Bringing a code change to this project should be executed as follows:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Make your changes. Do not forget about tests.
1. Squash your changes to single commit. Write a concise commit message in imperative mode as described [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
1. Rebase your changes to latest `master`.
1. Create a pull request.

Pull requests are very welcome. However, if you want to add a new feature, please discuss your ideas first using Github issues.

## License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
