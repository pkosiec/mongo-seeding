# Example of TypeScript import data

This example shows how to define import data in TypeScript files with model validation enabled. There are two collections defined: `categories` and `posts`.
Data import files are prepared to show multiple possibilities of TypeScript data definition. In some data import files there are used helper methods defined in `helpers` directory.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this example, it's recommended to install the following tools:

- [Docker](https://docker.com) (optional) - to run MongoDB and Mongo Seeding Docker Image
- [NodeJS with NPM](https://nodejs.org) (optional) - to run JavaScript example

## Preparations

1.  After cloning the repository, navigate to this directory.
1.  Run MongoDB on your local machine on port 27017. The recommended way is to use Docker:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo
    ```

1.  Navigate to the `./example` directory.
1.  To install all needed dependencies of import data, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Import data

In order to import the sample data, use one of Mongo Seeding tools. The following instructions will result in sample data import to `testing` database. The database will be dropped before import.

### JavaScript library

To import data from TypeScript files, the application, that utilizes Mongo Seeding library has to have TypeScript execution support configured. This tutorial shows how to setup it properly.

1.  Initialize a new Node.js project in this directory (folder, which contains this Readme file) with the command:

    ```
    npm init -y
    ```

1.  Create a new `index.js` file in the same directory with the following content:

    ```javascript
    require('ts-node').register();
    const path = require('path');
    const { Seeder } = require('mongo-seeding');

    const config = {
      database: {
        name: 'testing',
      },
      dropDatabase: true,
    };
    const seeder = new Seeder(config);
    const collections = seeder.readCollectionsFromPath(
      path.resolve('./example/data'),
      {
        extensions: ['js', 'json', 'ts'],
        transformers: [Seeder.Transformers.replaceDocumentIdWithUnderscoreId],
      },
    );

    seeder
      .import(collections)
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Success');
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log('Error', err);
      });
    ```

1.  To install all required dependencies used in your `index.js` application, run the command:

    ```bash
    npm install mongo-seeding typescript ts-node --save
    ```

1.  Turn on the debug output from `mongo-seeding` library and run the newly created app to import data:

    ```bash
    DEBUG=mongo-seeding node index.js
    ```

To see the full description of the JS library usage, read the **[Readme](../../core/README.md)** file of the Mongo Seeding.

### CLI

Make sure that you have the [Mongo Seeding CLI](../../cli) installed. Then, run the following command from this directory (folder, which contains this Readme file):

```bash
seed --drop-database --replace-id --db-name testing ./example/data
```

To see the full description of the CLI usage, read the **[Readme](../../cli/README.md)** file of the Mongo Seeding CLI.

### Docker image

Execute the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --network="host" -e DB_NAME=testing -e REPLACE_ID=true -e DROP_DATABASE=true -v /absolute/path/to/examples/import-data-ts/example/:/absolute/path/to/examples/import-data-ts/example/ -w /absolute/path/to/examples/import-data-ts/example/data pkosiec/mongo-seeding
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with your absolute path to this cloned repository.

To read more how to run the Docker image with all configuration parameters, read the **[Readme](../../docker-image/README.md)** file of the Mongo Seeding Docker image.
